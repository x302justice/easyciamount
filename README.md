# easyciamount
a godmode9 script that can be executed. allows for mounting CIA files by just entering it's name, simple for people who don't want to
go through directories to unpack cias manually, now you just have to do that second part(hoping to change that)


plans:

1) directory access

2)automatically unpacking files

~~3)more than just cia mounting~~ done!

~~4)a menu to select what you want to mount~~ done!

~~5)for my code to not be visible on the top screen~~ done!
